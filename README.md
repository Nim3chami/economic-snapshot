# Economic Dashboard Web Application

## Overview
This is a **web-based interactive dashboard** that visualizes real-time and historical economic data of countries. The system integrates public APIs to fetch country metadata and economic indicators, providing users with a clear, visually appealing, and responsive interface to analyze economic trends.

The dashboard displays country-specific data such as GDP, inflation, unemployment, interest rates, government debt, exports, imports, government revenue, and health expenditure. Historical trends are rendered in **interactive charts** for comparison and analysis.
